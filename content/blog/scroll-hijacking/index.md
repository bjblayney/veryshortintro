This is my first post on my new fake blog. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I dont even know what a blog is. I'm posting here to help me solidify some ideas. If you think you can help. Please do so.

Should be interesting in the future.

Here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[Solar irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance).

> The study and measurement of solar irradiance have several important applications, including the prediction of energy generation from solar power plants, the heating and cooling loads of buildings, and in climate modeling and weather forecasting.
