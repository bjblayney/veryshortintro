Time is a key object of fascination.

I read a bunch of time travel books last year, and am watching a bunch of shows/movies that deal with time travel this year. It's interesting to see the different flavours and laws applied to time travel. 

I couldn't be the first to think our fascination with time travel comes from our very human perception of the passage of time. Remembering the past, stuck in the present, planning for an altered future.
